Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning


Developed a machine learning classification model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on a dataset of health indicators, including age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, and lifestyle habits (smoking, physical activity, etc.).

1.Data Processing: Conducted data exploration and preprocessing, handling missing values, and applied feature scaling (using StandardScaler). Categorical variables such as gender, cholesterol, glucose, and occupation were encoded using one-hot encoding.

2.Modeling: Trained multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, to predict the presence of heart disease.

3.Evaluation: Evaluated models using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

4.User Interaction: Integrated a user input system allowing real-time predictions where users can provide their health indicators, and the model predicts whether they are likely to have heart disease.

5.Tools/Technologies: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
